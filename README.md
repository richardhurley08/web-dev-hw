I am taking this class because I am very interested in computers and creating something from nothing. I am seeking a Media Arts degree where I feel I can do just that. To building something from a blank slate or just an idea is appealing to me.

But what exactly is the internet?
  * 80% of the internet has not been indexed yet.
  * every webpage is an average of 19 clicks away from every other web page.
  * Each day Google recieves 5,000,000 search inquiries it has never been asked before.
