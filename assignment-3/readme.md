## Asignment 3

+ A page can only have one <head> element and one <body> element.


    + The <head> element contains processing information and document data. The site visitors can't see the information inside this element. <title> is only required element.
    + The <body> contains all the visible data.


+ The structural markup organizes the site's information and helps the users navigate. The semantic markup defines the meaning of the information shown.
