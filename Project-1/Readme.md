## Project 1
---

+ The Browser I use is Chrome. I use safari on my cellphone. Browsers take all the HTML code and requests information until it finds the correct location its requesting. The server that contains the information requested then sends the web page in bits and is assembled to displays all the content of the website.

+ On the Wayback Machine I looked up University of Montana. It felt retro when compared to our websites today. The pictures were low quility and it felt like everything was rectangles and squares.

+ During this week I followed this steps:
  * I learned how browsers work.
  * I read a little of out text that finally came in the mail.
  * I made my first index.HTML document.
  * I made my repo a webpage with GitHub page.
  * In project-1 I found a poem by Will Rogers called "Donâ€™t Let Yesterday Take Up Too Much Of Today."

+ I did have a problem with getting my screenshot to show but after some troubleshooting I figured out it was a screenshot placement issue.
