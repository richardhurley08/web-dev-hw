  <h2>Don’t Let Yesterday Take Up Too Much Of Today</h2>

  <h3>Will-Rogers</h3>

  <hr />

   <pre />Look around and see that you are surrounded by unlimited potential. Look within and make enough room for what is possible.
  Find it in yourself to believe in miracles. For a new day is given to you by the Master Builder,
and it has arrived with all His majesty and power. Therefore you have more time to find your destiny, a chance to tell someone that you’re sorry,
… to love someone completely. May you know that you are fearfully and beautifully created,
and that you are precious in God’s sight. Every day that He gives you is gift, a new dawn that is waking,
Open your eyes…
